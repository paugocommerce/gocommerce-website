It is also important to note that many brands we have scaled will have a large degree of dependence on GoCommerce as we act as the seller of record in major platforms; the algorithm scores, customer data, purchase history, and proven profitable target audiences are retained by GoCommerce.

                                    <p className='about-us-desc'>
                                    We believe that companies are the new universities and that GoCommerce is a place where talented people can become experts and innovators in eCommerce.  We also recognize that limited eCommerce talent is a potential bottleneck that can limit our growth. This is why we started the initiative called <b>“GoCommerce University”</b> that would provide structured programs for learning and innovation across the whole organization.
                                    </p>
                                    <p className='about-us-desc'>
                                    We have created a standardized playbook for launching, growing and revitalizing brands’ online business which are constantly updated and turned into training modules.  Key members of a team who excel in specific aspects are nominated to become lecturers and trainers so that more can learn from their methodologies that lead to success. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h1 className='story-title'>Why make the switch?</h1>

                                    GoCommerce’s competitive advantage is its ecosystem of technology and key services for Brand & Chat Commerce, In-Platform & Performance Marketing, Live Commerce, and finally our Warehousing & Fulfillment Center, ShipGo. Our brand partners can rest easy and know that their business is in great hands.
